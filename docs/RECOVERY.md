# ANANSI Ultimate — Recovery Guide

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md`, `docs/BUILD_STATUS.md`, the active plan, and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
2. Check `git status` and inspect the last verified commit recorded in build status.
3. Do not discard uncommitted work. Identify the active phase and its acceptance criteria.
4. Re-run the phase's verification commands before changing code.
5. Continue only the unfinished acceptance criteria, then record evidence and update status.
6. If requirements conflict, stop implementation and record the conflict in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

Recovery checkpoints should contain source, tests, and the corresponding status/documentation updates. Never treat a build artifact alone as a recoverable project state.
